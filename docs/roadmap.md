# Product Roadmap & Iteration Plan

## MVP 1 – Core Simulation Engine

* Load team rosters and player batting/pitching stats from CSV
* Implement 3-level simulation engine:

  * Level 1: Team-level batting average
  * Level 2: Player-level batting average with rotation
  * Level 3: Pitcher-adjusted probabilities and hit-type logic
* Simulate 9-inning games and loop for 1000 trials
* Export win counts, average scores, and run distributions

## MVP 2 – Results Analysis & Delivery

* Generate histogram of score distributions
* Compare win rates between Cubs and White Sox
* Summarize average runs/game by team and model
* Complete documentation: specs, WBS, backlog, activity log, status log
* Prepare final GitHub submission structure and README
